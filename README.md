# Introduction

How it is used is available in the README file of each script.

There are simple python scripts for penetration testing. Hacking with Python is a simple and extensible tool for getting started with ethical hacking activities and running python scripts. Scripts will be constantly updated and new scripts will be added.

I hope these scripts will be useful...

Happy Hacking 👨‍💻
